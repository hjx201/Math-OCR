# Math-OCR

Mathematical Optical Character Recognition project done for Robot Vision Spring 2020. /
The code uses Tesseract OCR and OpenCV to read photo data of math equations, solve them, and display the answers on the camera feed.

Visual Studio files are for Tesseract training, and the python files are for the solver and camera.
